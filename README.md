This is my first tryout with JavaFX.

It is a WebBrowser.
I tried to use WebView object from the `javafx` `api`.

It is an experiment, not well implemented, full of bugs and lacking of many options. But it browses.
I hope it shows JavaFX potential.

It runs only with **Java 8**.

## Build

To build, you just need to type on the command line:

    $ gradle jar

## Run

Once builded, you can run the browser issuing the next command:

    $ java -jar out/artifacts/Web/Web.jar

Or you could copy that jar file to an apropiate location (e.g. your USB Flash), and double click the file to run the program (if java is correctly setup).
